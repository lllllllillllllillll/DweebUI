## About

* I started this as a personal project to get more familiar with Javascript and Node.js, so there may be some rough edges and spaghetti code.
* I'm open to any contributions but you may want to wait until I reach v1.0 first.
* Please post issues and discussions so I know what bugs and features to focus on.
* DweebUI is a management interface and should not be directly exposed to the internet.
